# Security Policy

## Project status

`@lazyants/transkribus-mcp-server` is an independent MCP server. It is
**not** an official product of, endorsed by, or affiliated with the
Transkribus REST API vendor, Anthropic, or the Model Context Protocol
project. Security guarantees are limited to what this repository's
maintainers commit to in [Reporting a vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability)
below; the upstream vendor's security team is not responsible for issues in
this wrapper.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 2.x   | ✅        |

Older majors are not supported. Once `3.x` is released, `2.x` will receive
security fixes for at least 6 months.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue in `@lazyants/transkribus-mcp-server`, please
report it privately rather than opening a public GitHub issue.

**Preferred channel — GitHub Security Advisories**

Open a private advisory at
<https://github.com/lazyants/transkribus-mcp-server/security/advisories/new>.
GitHub will notify the maintainers and let us coordinate a fix and disclosure
timeline with you.

**Alternative — email**

If GitHub Security Advisories are not available to you, send a description
to **smaxims@gmail.com** with `[transkribus-mcp-server security]` in the subject.
We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.

## What to include

- The version of `@lazyants/transkribus-mcp-server` and Node.js you tested.
- A minimal reproduction (preferably a payload, an MCP-tool invocation, or
  a stack trace).
- Your assessment of impact: data leakage, unauthenticated execution,
  privilege escalation, denial of service, etc.

## What is in scope

- The MCP server itself: tool registration, request handling, the
  `services/transkribus.ts` HTTP client, and any rate-limiting / retry layer.
- The published npm artifact (`dist/`).
- Sample configurations in `README.md` that could mislead users into an
  insecure setup.

## What is out of scope

- Vulnerabilities in the upstream Transkribus REST API itself —
  please report those to the upstream vendor.
- Issues in transitive devDependencies that do not ship in the published
  package (e.g. `vitest`, its sub-deps). We track them via Dependabot but
  do not treat them as security incidents.
- Misconfiguration of the consumer's own environment (leaked
  `TRANSKRIBUS_PASSWORD`, over-privileged API tokens, etc.).

## Responsible disclosure

Please do not disclose the issue publicly until a fix has been released and
the maintainers have had a reasonable opportunity to coordinate. We commit
to working on a fix promptly and crediting reporters in the changelog
unless you ask to remain anonymous.
